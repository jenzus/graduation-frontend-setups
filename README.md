# Making frontend setups easy

This repository allows developers to create a front-end setup with all the tools a developer needs.

Included:

- view-layer
- basic implementation of view-layer
- webpack
- eslint
- githooks to prevent the messy git merges ;)

## How is this different than the other tools?

This tool is used to create a small project of the latest and greatest view-layers. The implementation is so small,
developers can easily customize the setup (if they want to). The 'setup tool' is even removing itself when completed,
so no unnecessary files are left. No global packages are needed to use this package (besides node and npm (or yarn ;)).

## All right, how can I use it?

The only requirement is having node.js installed [check it out here](https://nodejs.org/en/). If you want to use yarn, [an awesome npm alternative](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), no problem!
Got you covered bro ;)

- Clone this git repo: `git clone https://github.com/mjanssen/graduation-frontend-setups.git`
- Enter the directory and run `npm install` / `yarn install`
- Run `node index.js _setup_` (see below for the available setups)
- Let the node application handle everything
- Profit!

Run `npm run dev` / `yarn run dev` to start the application!

Happy coding <3
